# FullyKioskImmichScreenSaver
PowerShell script to prepare a random selection of images from Immich and upload them to Fully Kiosk running on an Android tablet.

I have a small Alpine Linux LXC running Nginx on my home network Proxmox. I have this PowerShell script set up on that same LXC to run as a cron task overnight.
I used PowerShell because I'm familiar with it, and it provides the functionality I needed.

See [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-alpine?view=powershell-7.5) for the installation of PowerShell on Alpine Linux.
